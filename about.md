I have been reversing for over 11 years now. During that time, I have analyzed a variety of file types, written parsers to extract configuration data from malware and developed YARA signatures to identify, categorize samples and mentored those new to malware analysis. Even though I have been doing this for some time, I am still learning! Which is one of the most rewarding aspects of RE!
